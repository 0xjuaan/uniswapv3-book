One significant limitation of our implementation is that it allows only swaps within a pool–if there&amp;rsquo;s no pool for a swap of tokens, then swapping between these tokens is not possible. This is not so in Uniswap since it allows multi-pool swaps. In this chapter, we&amp;rsquo;re going to add multi-pool swaps to our implementation.</description></item><item><title>Factory Contract</title><link>https://uniswapv3book.com/docs/milestone_4/factory-contract/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://uniswapv3book.com/docs/milestone_4/factory-contract/</guid><description>Factory Contract # Uniswap is designed in a way that assumes many discrete Pool contracts, with each pool handling swaps of one token pair. This looks problematic when we want to swap between two tokens that don&amp;rsquo;t have a pool–is there&amp;rsquo;s no pool, no swaps are possible. However, we can still do intermediate swaps: first swap to a token that has pairs with either of the tokens and then swap this token to the target token.</description></item></channel></rss>
