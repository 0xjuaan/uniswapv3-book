<a class=anchor href=#introduction-to-markets>#</a></h1><h2 id=how-centralized-exchanges-work>How centralized exchanges work
<a class=anchor href=#how-centralized-exchanges-work>#</a></h2><p>In this book, we&rsquo;ll build a decentralized exchange (DEX) that will run on Ethereum. There&rsquo;re multiple approaches to how an
exchange can be designed. All centralized exchanges have <em>an order book</em> at their core. An order book is just a journal that
stores all sell or buy orders that traders what to make. Each order in this book contains a price the order must be
executed at and the amount that must be bought or sold.</p><p>[TODO: illustration]</p><p>For trading to happen, there must exist <em>liquidity</em>, which is simply the availability of assets on a market. If you
want to buy a wardrobe but no one is selling one, there&rsquo;s no liquidity. If you want to sell a wardrobe but no one wants
to buy it, there&rsquo;s liquidity but no buyers. If there&rsquo;s no liquidity, there&rsquo;s nothing to buy or sell.</p><p>On centralized exchanges, the order book is where liquidity is accumulated. If someone places a sell order, they provide
liquidity to the market. If someone places a buy order, they expected the market to have liquidity, otherwise, no trade
is possible.</p><p>Since liquidity is not always available, but markets are still interested in trades, entities called <em>market makers</em> were
established. A market maker is a firm or an individual who provides liquidity to markets, that is someone who has a lot
of money and who buys different assets to sell them on exchanges. For this job, market makers are paid by exchanges.</p><h2 id=how-decentralized-exchanges-work>How decentralized exchanges work
<a class=anchor href=#how-decentralized-exchanges-work>#</a></h2><p>Don&rsquo;t be surprised, decentralized exchanges also need liquidity. And they also need someone who provides it to traders
of a wide variety of assets. However, this process cannot be handled in a centralized way. A decentralized solution
must exist. There are multiple decentralized solutions and the same solutions are implemented in different ways, but
our focus will be on how Uniswap solves this problem.</p><h2 id=automated-market-makers>Automated Market Makers
<a class=anchor href=#automated-market-makers>#</a></h2><p>The evolution of on-chain markets brought us to the idea of Automated Market Makers (AMM). As the name implies, this algorithm
works exactly like market makers but in an automated way. Moreover, it&rsquo;s decentralized and permissionless (anyone can
use them).</p><h3 id=what-is-an-amm>What is an AMM?
<a class=anchor href=#what-is-an-amm>#</a></h3><p>The core idea is <strong>pooling</strong>-different and not connected groups of people are incentivized to put their assets (tokens)
into <em>pools</em>, which are smart contracts. Anyone else can use these pool contracts to trade, thanks to liquidity
provided by the first group.</p><p>[TODO: illustration]</p><p>What makes this approach different from centralized exchanges is that <strong>the smart contracts are fully automated and not
managed by anyone</strong>. There are no managers, admins, privileged users, etc. There are only <strong>liquidity providers</strong> and
<strong>traders</strong>, and all the algorithms are programmed and immutable.</p></article><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"></div><script>(function(){function e(n){const e=window.getSelection(),t=document.createRange();t.selectNodeContents(n),e.removeAllRanges(),e.addRange(t)}document.querySelectorAll("pre code").forEach(t=>{t.addEventListener("click",function(){e(t.parentElement),navigator.clipboard&&navigator.clipboard.writeText(t.parentElement.textContent)})})})()</script></footer><div class=book-comments></div><label for=menu-control class="hidden book-menu-overlay"></label></div><aside class=book-toc><div class=book-toc-content><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#introduction-to-markets>Introduction to markets</a><ul><li><a href=#how-centralized-exchanges-work>How centralized exchanges work</a></li><li><a href=#how-decentralized-exchanges-work>How decentralized exchanges work</a></li><li><a href=#automated-market-makers>Automated Market Makers</a><ul><li><a href=#what-is-an-amm>What is an AMM?</a></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div></aside></main></body></html>
